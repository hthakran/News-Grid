                        newspaper covered national and internation news separately, but it merged into a single entity.

                        Before the invention of newspapers in the early 17th century, official government bulletins were
                        circulated at times in some centralized empires. The first documented use of an organized
                        courier
                        service for the diffusion of written documents is in Egypt, where Pharaohs used courier for the
                        diffusion of their decrees in the territory of the state. The spread of the news has always been
                        linked ot the communications networks in place to disseminate it. Thus, political, religious and
                        commercial interests have historically controlled, expanded and monitored communications
                        channels by
                        which news could spread. Postal services have long been clsoely entwined with the maintenance of
                        political power in a large area. We have our headquarters in different countries and we are
                        based
                        out in India, Gurugram.
